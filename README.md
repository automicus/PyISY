## PyISY

### Python Library for the ISY Controller

This library allows for easy interaction with ISY nodes, programs, program,
climate module, and network module. This class also allows for functions to be
assigned as handlers when ISY parameters are changed. ISY parameters can be
monitored automatically as changes are reported from the device.

### PyISY_beta Fork & PyPi Package

The PyISY_beta package is a drop in replacement & testing package for the original PyISY.  It was created to provide a package to test new modifications while waiting to be incorporated into the original scope.
